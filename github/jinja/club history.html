On the evening of 10 March 1905 in an upstairs room at the Rising Sun pub,</br> Chelsea FC was formed. Among the founding directors were millionaire</br> owner Henry</p><p style="color:yellow;"> Augustus ‘Gus’ Mears, his brother Joseph, their brother-in-law Henry Boyer, publican Alfred Jane’s and his nephew Edwin, who ran the Rising Sun. The club, the</br> brainchild of another founder, Frederick Parker, would</p><p style="color:gold;"> be started from scratch to fill Gus Mears’s</br> ambitious stadium, being built across the road at Stamford Bridge by the famous architect</br> Archibald Leitch. Scotland</p><p style="color:white;"> international Jacky Robertson was engaged as the fledgling club’s</br> player-manager. In collaboration with Parker,</br> who also engineered Chelsea’s admission to Football League Division Two, Robertson constructed a</br> squad including larger-than-life Willie Fouke: the club hired football’s first ball-boys to emphasize the 23-stone goalkeeper's presence. The huge new arena</p><p style="color:gray;"#808080"> debuted with </br>a 4-0 friendly win against Liverpool in September 1905, supported by London’s first 4-page</br> match day football programmer, which cleverly fed the metropolis’s growing hunger for the professional game. Success came spectacularly fast: the table-top clash with Mancheste</br>r United on Good Friday 1906 attracted a staggering attendance of 67,000.</p> 



Promotion to the First Division was achieved in 1907 and over the ensuing campaign the newly nicknamed</br> ‘Pensioners’ attracted the biggest crowds ever known in Britain. The most popular entertainer of the day, George Robe, even signed up as a player. For the first few seasons</br> the players wore Eton Blue, the horse racing colors of club President Lord Cardigan, a much lighter hue than the shirts of today. Other aspects are more enduring: the first </br>top-flight London derby, a 2-1 Chelsea win against Arsenal, was contested on 9 November 1907. A similar outcome settled the first ever encounter with Totten ham Hotspur on 18 December</br> 1909. And, of course, Chelsea has never moved away from the famous stadium on Fulmar Road. New star names started to establish themselves at the Bridge, including center-forward </br>George Hilsdon, the first Pensioner to hit a century of goals (immortalized in </br>a weathervane likeness on top of the current East Stand). In just a few short years the </br>personality of Chelsea FC was being established: wealthy, ambitious, and fashionable </br>and with immense drawing power. Spirit Of The Age The horse and carriage is on the way out</br> as a mode of transport after the 1903 Motor Car Act, which introduced vehicle registration </br>and penalties for reckless driving, while raising the speed limit from 14 miles per hour to a top hat-dislodging 20 mph.
